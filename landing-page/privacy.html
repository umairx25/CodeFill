  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 30, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>CodeFill</strong> is a Chrome Extension that helps users quickly extract verification codes from their
    Gmail inbox and copy them to their clipboard for easy use during sign-in processes.</p>

  <h2>What Information We Access</h2>
  <p>CodeFill requests the following data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to your Gmail inbox (read-only) via the <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly</code>
      scope.</li>
    <li>Your basic Google profile (email and name) for login verification.</li>
    <li>Clipboard access to automatically copy your verification code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your data only for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To scan recent emails and extract verification codes sent by services you log into.</li>
    <li>To automatically copy the extracted code to your clipboard for faster login.</li>
    <li>To maintain login session information locally in your browser.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Data Protection and Security</h2>
  <p>


    We take precautions to protect your Google account data. Our app communicates with the backend securely
    via HTTPS to prevent interception during transit. However, we do not store your Google data (such as access tokens
    or email data) on our servers. <br> <br>

    All authentication and token handling is managed on your device using using OAuth2. Your access and refresh tokens are
    stored locally in your browser’s storage (e.g., Chrome Local Storage). This means: <br> <br>
    • Your sensitive tokens remain on your device only and are not transmitted to any third-party servers. <br>
    • We do not persist or log any Google user data on our backend. <br>
    • We rely on the browser’s built-in security to protect stored data, and we do not access it unless explicitly
    triggered by your actions. 
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>
    CodeFill stores your Google access token temporarily in your browser's local storage
    (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>), used only to fetch verification codes. No data is stored externally or on our
    servers, and your inbox contents are never saved, logged, or shared.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Google APIs to access Gmail content with your permission. Authentication is handled through
    <strong>OAuth2</strong> and the Chrome Identity API.</p>

  <h2>Your Consent</h2>
  <p>By installing and using CodeFill, you consent to the access and usage of your Gmail account data as described in
    this policy.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share or sell your data to any third parties. All processing occurs on-device.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a
      href="mailto:support@codefill.app">codefill@uarham.me</a>.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This policy may be updated periodically. We recommend checking this page occasionally to stay informed.
